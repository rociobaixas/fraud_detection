# Fraud Detection Case Study: Identifying Credit Card Fraudulent Transactions

## Introduction:
In this case study, we will explore a fraud detection problem using a dataset containing information about credit card transactions. The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify transactions as fraudulent or benign based on various features associated with each transaction.

## Dataset Description:
The dataset consists of the following columns:
__Column Name__	__Description__
step	Maps a unit of time in the real world. 1 step = 1 hour of time.
Customer	Unique customer ID associated with each transaction.
zipCodeOrigin	The zip code of the transaction's origin/source.
Merchant	The unique ID of the merchant involved in the transaction.
zipMerchant	The zip code of the merchant.
Age	Categorized age of the customer:
	0: <= 18
	1: 19-25
	2: 26-35
	3: 36-45
	4: 46-55
	5: 56-65
	6: > 65
	U: Unknown
Gender	Gender of the customer:
	E: Enterprise
	F: Female
	M: Male
	U: Unknown
Category	Category of the purchase.
Amount	The amount of the purchase.
Fraud	Target variable: 1 if transaction is fraudulent, 0 if benign.


## Objective:
The main objective of this case study is to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify fraudulent credit card transactions based on the provided dataset.

## Key Steps for consideration:
### Data Preprocessing:
•	Handle missing values, if any, using appropriate techniques.
•	Encode categorical variables (Age, Gender) using techniques such as one-hot encoding.
•	Split the dataset into features (independent variables) and the target variable (Fraud).

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
•	Explore the distribution of the target variable (Fraud) to understand the class imbalance.
•	Analyze the distribution of features and their relationships with the target variable.
•	Visualize trends, patterns, and potential outliers in the data.

### Feature Engineering:
•	Create new relevant features if possible, such as the time of day from the 'step' column.
•	Normalize or scale numerical features as needed.

### Model Selection:
•	Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for fraud detection, such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, or Neural Networks.
•	Set up a suitable evaluation metric considering the class imbalance, such as F1-score or Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC).

### Model Training:
•	Split the dataset into training and testing subsets.
•	Train the selected models on the training data.

### Model Evaluation:
•	Evaluate the models using the chosen evaluation metric on the test data.
•	Compare the performance of different models and select the best-performing one.

### Model Interpretation:
•	Interpret the model's predictions and identify the key features influencing fraud detection.

### Handling Imbalance:
•	Implement techniques to address class imbalance, such as oversampling, under sampling, or using synthetic data generation (SMOTE).

### Fine-tuning and Optimization:
•	Optimize hyperparameters of the selected model for better performance.

### Key deliverables:
•	Push the final model code to a Github and share the link.
•	Create a PowerPoint explaining the steps you have considered and why.
•	Create recommendations and key outcomes which can be presented to the business teams.
